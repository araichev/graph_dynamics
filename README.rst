graph_dynamics
==============
Python 2.7/Sage code for running graph dynamics simulations.
Provides functionality to iteratively change the 
vertex colors of a given graph under various update rules.

Sage graph objects are used throughout.
For more about Sage Graph objects, see the 
`Sage graph theory documentation  <http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/sage/graphs/graph.html>`_.
