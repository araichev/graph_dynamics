graph_dynamics
==============
Python 2.7/Sage code for running graph dynamics simulations.
Provides functionality to iteratively change the 
vertex colors of a given graph under various update rules.

Sage graph objects are used throughout.
For more about Sage Graph objects, see the 
`Sage graph theory documentation  <http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/sage/graphs/graph.html>`_.

See the Sage worksheet file (.sws) for usage examples.
I also printed the worksheet as a PDF, which you can view in your browser 
`here <https://rawgithub.com/araichev/graph_dynamics/master/examples.pdf>`_.
